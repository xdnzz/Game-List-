Originally, I was building a simple project just to use Axios, the API I used to built it is really
amazing and I decided to add some more stuff and push it into github. I could have made it a way prettier but, eventually, that wasnt the idea.
Maybe i come back to it to add some more usabilities that the API allows to.
